1、shell
(since i use mac OS system, so i only mark things that is useful for mac OS)
  mac OS - bash
  open terminal - a single line on the top (shell prompt)

  **basic and convenient use:**
  1) it can show date and specific time when you enter "date" on it
  2) when write "echo + anything you want it to show you", it will just show the things you write after "echo".
    e.g. type "echo 'Hello, world'" ; "echo Hello\ World"
  3) environment variable:
    a) echo $PATH: show the path of command "echo" on my comnputer
    b) pwd: show currently location
    c) cd + ...: change the currently working directory (shell prompt will show that)
       (cd -: go back to last directory）
    d) ls (+ ...): show the files list of current directory
       *absolute path: path that fully determine the locatiuon of a file*
       *relative path: path that is relative to the place where you are*
